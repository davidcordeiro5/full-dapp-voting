# Voting DApp

This repository contains the voting system smart contract and the front end to interact with it.
The voting smart contract is based on [Voting.sol](https://github.com/lecascyril/CodesSatoshi/blob/main/Voting.sol), it has been modified to avoid a potential DoS Gas limit attack on the first contract version.

  ## Architecture

- **Profile**

  Component containing informations of the current user. The profile is refreshed if the current user changes
- **Work flow steps**


  Component to follow all steps of a voting session. It is updated every time the owner change the status.
- **Forms**

  Component containing controls of the current step. It is dynamic in function of the current user and his role in the voting session.
- **Metrics**

  Component to follow the event generated by the smart contract. It allows the user to see the voter list and the proposal list if he is a voter.
 
**_For this decentralized application, we have chosen to not let a voter see the other votes so as to not influence the user's decision. Of course, he can see the choice of other voters if he has smart contract knowledge._**
  
  
  ## Decentralized application
  
  The DApp is deployed at the following address https://full-dapp-voting-ten.vercel.app/
  The smart contract is available on the goerli blockchain at the address [0x8Dd16a0Aa4A70Ab2a3576F30d4CDe78F1e214AB0](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x8dd16a0aa4a70ab2a3576f30d4cde78f1e214ab0)
